# Problem Statement
Machine Learning model to  predict the quality of wine

# Dataset
The dataset consists of 12 attributes of different wines. Each row represents a wine sample, and the columns represent different features of the wine. Here's a breakdown of the attributes in the dataset: 

  1. Fixed Acidity: The concentration of non-volatile acids in the wine, which can impact its taste and stability.
  2. Volatile Acidity: The concentration of volatile acids, which can give wine a vinegar-like taste if present in excessive amounts.
  3. Citric Acid: The amount of citric acid in the wine, which can contribute to its freshness and flavor.
  4. Residual Sugar: The amount of sugar remaining after fermentation, affecting the wine's sweetness.
  5. Chlorides: The concentration of salts in the wine, which can influence its taste and mouthfeel.
  6. Free Sulfur Dioxide: The presence of sulfur dioxide in a free form, which acts as a preservative and an antioxidant.
  7. Total Sulfur Dioxide: The total amount of sulfur dioxide in the wine, which is a sum of free and bound forms.
  8. Density: The density of the wine, which can be related to its alcohol content and sweetness.
  9. pH: The acidity level of the wine, which influences its stability and taste perception.
  10. Sulphates: The concentration of sulfates, which can affect the wine's aroma and preservation.
  11. Alcohol: The alcohol content of the wine, which contributes to its body and overall perception.
  12. Quality: This attributes represents the sensory quality of the wine, typically rated on a scale from 0 to 10.
